## About the Video Course
Learn to craft websites that provide an optimal viewing experience on any device using HTML5. We will walk you through Responsive Web Design from digital mock-ups to finished products.

Learning Apache Maven 3 will take you through a detailed guide on building a real world Java application, covering core concepts and terminologies along the way. This video course is your answer to almost all your needs for building high-quality Java applications with well-explained code and a number of illustrations to make your learning easier and faster.

Learning Apache Maven 3 starts by building a “hello world” Java application and then leads you to build multi-module projects containing an MVC web application, a web service, and a web service client module using Enterprise Java Frameworks. 

You will start the video course by setting up a development environment to work with Apache Maven 3. You will then create simple Java applications, and next move on to more complex Java applications with Apache Maven as the build tool.
